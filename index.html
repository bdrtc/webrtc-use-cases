    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The current livestreaming multimedia ecosystem is showing diverse and robust growth trends. It covers
      livestreaming content from both institutions and individuals in various fields to meet the diverse needs of users.
      In this ecosystem, major tech companies are strategically involved in different areas to provide richer,
      practical, and entertaining livestreaming experiences.

    </p>

    <p>

      Alibaba Group demonstrates strong capabilities in the livestreaming sector. Its livestreaming e-commerce combines
      shopping and entertainment, offering consumers immersive shopping experiences. Through methods like hosts
      showcasing products and interactive Q&A sessions, consumers are engaged in making purchases. Additionally, Alibaba
      also offers fundamental livestreaming cloud services, spanning education and gaming sectors, providing technical
      support for creating livestreaming platforms for businesses and individuals.

    </p>

    <p>

      Chia Mobile MiGu, an integrated media platform, focuses on providing diverse livestreaming content. Particularly in
      large-scale event livestreaming, MiGu offers real-time broadcasts of significant events like sports competitions
      and music concerts, meeting users' demand for immediate experiences. Moreover, MiGu experiments with
      virtual-physical interactions using technologies like digital avatars, creating a more enriched virtual
      interactive experience for users.


    </p>

    <p>
      ByteDance plays a crucial role in interactive entertainment, online education, and conferencing. Its TikTok
      platform has become a globally popular short video platform, providing users with abundant entertainment content,
      including livestreaming. ByteDance has also ventured into livestreamed educational content to accommodate learners
      seeking flexible learning approaches. In the business sector, its livestreamed conferencing solutions offer
      efficient remote communication and collaboration platforms for enterprises.

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Generic Packetization and Depacketization Mechanism for Audio Transmission</h2>
      <p>
        When transmitting audio data, sending audio packets with a size greater than 1500 bytes per frame will result in transmission failure.Spatial audio formats like "Audio Vivid" have audio packets per frame that are larger than 1500 bytes, requiring developers to handle packetization and depacketization separately.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Receiving sounds from other devices when in background</h2>
      <p>
        An iOS device that has the microphone enabled and then switches to the background is unable to hear sounds from other devices.
